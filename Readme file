Printed Circuit Board Process Image Project
This is a Flask web application that demonstrates the use of a processed image dataset of Printed Circuit Boards (PCB). The application reads data from a CSV file, stores it in an SQLite database, and provides a simple web interface to view the data and learn about the project.

Features
Home Page: Introduction to the PCB Process Image Project.
About Page: Information about the dataset, including the source and variable types.
Data Page: Display of a sample of the dataset from the SQLite database.
Requirements
Python
Sqlite3
Flask
Pandas
Installation
Download the requirement file and Enter below code pip install -r requirements.txt

Project Structure
index.csv: The datase file.
Printed_circuit.db: The SQLite database file
README.md: Project documentation.
Running the Website
import sqlite3 import pandas as pd import csv from flask import Flask, render_template_string, render_template from werkzeug.serving import run_simple

df= pd.read_csv("index.csv")

Above Code is to import necessary liberary And Read dataset csv File
con = sqlite3.connect('Printed_circuit.db') cursor = con.cursor()

create_table = """CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Printed_ckt (ID INTPRIMARY KEY, XDATE ,  DATE, TEXT, TEXT, FLOAT, TEXT ); """ cursor.execute(create_table) df.to_sql('Printed_circuit', con, if_exists='replace', index=False)

con.commit() con.close()

Above code is to create database schema in sqlite3 named Printed_circuit.db file also creat table in it if not exsited and insert the data that we read from the database csv file.

The Next Step Is To Run Run the Flask application:
After Sucessfully Run The Application Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:9200 to view the application.

Web Structure
/: Home page with an introduction to the project and a sample of the data.
/about: About page with information about the dataset.
/data: Data page displaying a sample of the dataset from the SQLite database.
